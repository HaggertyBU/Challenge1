# Module_Challenge1 - Robinhood
## Overview and Origin

For this module challenge, I have selected Robinhood as my case study. Robinhood was founded by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt on April 18, 2013. The company is headquartered in Menlo Park, CA. According to their founders, the idea and thesis behind the company came about as "the need for a revolution in the brokerage space" took place. Previously, anytime a trade was made for an equity or exchange traded fund, the trader who was making a trade would pay a fee or commission to a broker who took their trade. With Robinhood, trades that take place do not require a trader to pay this fee or commission. With this revolution, Robinhood was successfully able to breakthrough in the financial services industry. Due to their success, Robinhood was able to advance through all their funding rounds and then became a publicly-traded company. They IPO'd on the NASDAQ exchange on July 29, 2021. Currently, Robinhood is valued at around $6B.

## Business Activities

Robinhood states that the specific financial problem the company is trying to alleviate is the high barriers to entry in the financial and investing world. Before Robinhood was introduced, investing brokerage platforms had several requirements that made it more difficult for someone to begin investing on various brokerage platforms. Among these difficulties typically included a $1,000+ minimum initial investment, a 3-5 day waiting period after signing up, and a $5-$10 commission fee for each trade. Robinhood realized that these barriers to entry were difficult for small-time traders and investors to overcome, so they sought out to challenge them. From this, Robinhood founded a platform that doesn't require a minimum investment, or any fees for each trade placed. Additionally, Robinhood instituted an instant deposit feature that no longer requires a 3-5 day waiting period for an ACH transfer to deposit.


Because of these solutions to the high barriers to entry within the industry, Robinhood was able to entice and develop a stronghold with their core intended customers, young investors. Robinhood's core intended customer range extends from young college-aged students to early career professionals. This range of customers is typically referred to as millennials. The millennial customer base that Robinhood targets is the largest portion of the US population today, as this demographic totals over 50% of the population. This audience is vast in size and will only continue to grow as more and more people enter this age range.

 

Because Robinhood implemented a breakthrough business model in this space, a ton of people have become loyal to the company and developed some knowledge for how the product works. This makes it very difficult for Robinhood's competitors to get people to abandon Robinhood and join other brokerages. This breakthrough gave Robinhood an "unfair advantage" on their competition.


The technology being used at Robinhood is very extensive. According to CrunchBase, "Robinhood uses 26 different technology products and services ranging from HTML 5 to Google Analytics to Google Fonts." These technologies help the company do a multitude of activities including user interface design, to capturing customer data analytics, and app troubleshooting. These technologies allow Robinhood to stay stable and running during high-volume and volatile markets, when they are needed most.

## Landscape

Robinhood is a diverse business that operates in several domains. Among these domains includes Investment Management, Personal Finance, and Blockchain/Cryptocurrencies. While Robinhood operates in these several domains, the main domain they focus on is in the investment management domain. Robinhood is integral to this domain as their breakthroughs have pushed a lot of the new ideas and innovations within the industry over the last 5-10 years. The largest impact that Robinhood has had on the industry is the concept of commission free trades. Before Robinhood, whenever a person placed a trade through a brokerage, the brokerage would take a certain percent cut of the trade, which is called the commission. Most of these commissions were in the range of $5-$10 per trade. This can add up as more and more trades are placed. These commissions are how brokerages are able to make money.

 

Robinhood came up with an innovative and creative concept to skirt commissions without giving up revenue from a process called Payment-for-Order-Flow (PFOF). PFOF occurs when a trader places a trade through a brokerage (Robinhood), the brokerage will then pass the trade order to a wholesale market-maker who then then places an order on a stock exchange. After that, the market maker will make a percentage from the bid-ask spread on the trade. They will then take a percentage of this spread and give a cut back to the brokerage. This is the process for how Robinhood makes money. Because of this innovation, the fees for placing trades decreased dramatically and people flocked to Robinhood from their previous brokers due to trades being cheaper there. Once this happened other brokerages had no other choice but to adapt a similar business model. Robinhoodâ€™s competitors such as Charles Schwab, TDAmeritrade, ETrade, and Interactive Brokers all implemented PFOF, ditching the commission-based fees. This led to lower barriers to entry for all potential new investors and the industry experienced a boom of new customers.

 

## Results

The impact from Robinhood on this industry has been significant. Due to Robinhood's success, the rise of "retail investors", or small-account investors has occurred. According to marketplacefairness.com, around 20% of new retail investors started investing since Robinhood was founded.

 

The core metrics that measure the success of Robinhood have changed over the last few years. This is true for any company that transitions from privately held to publicly-traded. Before they were publicly-traded the success of Robinhood was measured in non-GAAP metrics such as the number of users using the app on a daily basis, as well as the total amount of volume on the app on a given trading day. The total number of users using the app has shown tremendous growth for Robinhood, as they have gone from 2 million users in 2017 to 23 million users in 2022. This growth in non-GAAP metrics indicate the company is growing very fast and performing well.

 

Since IPO'ing, GAAP recognized metrics such as revenue and earnings have been the focus for determining the success of the business. These numbers don't paint as good of a picture as the non-GAAP numbers do. Via YahooFinance, the company had an EBITDA margin of -105,000(k) in 2019, and the company has only continued to operate at a loss with an EBITDA of -3,700,000(k) in 2021. If they want to continue to stay in business moving forward, Robinhood will have to figure out how to continue an upward growth path without losing so much money. When compared to their competition at other brokerages like TDAmeritrade, Charles Schwab, and Interactive Brokers, Robinhood's growth is promising, but their profitability and cash flow leaves much to be desired.




## Recommendations

If I were advising Robinhood, I would suggest to them that they implement a robo-advising service. Being that a core majority of their audience is young people, they don't have much experience investing their money for the long run. Because of this, they are highly likely to make mistakes in their investment approaches or just not invest their money at all. By implementing a robo-advisor service, they could guide people to starting that process. I believe this would benefit the company by adding legitimacy to their services and expanding their audience base. The more services they add to their product, the more likely they are to acquire new potential customers.

 

The additional technologies for robo-advising wouldn't be too complex to institute for Robinhood. Using simple computer algorithms for setting asset allocations based upon a customer's age, risk tolerance, and personal financial goals, their robo-advisors could make suggestions and give advice to a person seeking out their service. Additionally, the same algorithms could be coded to automate the rebalance and tax-loss harvesting process to maximize a portfolio and keep the young investors on track for the long-haul. By focusing more and more on long-term investing through robo-advising, Robinhood is more likely to retain their customer base for longer periods of time, as people will be less likely to go investment-product service hopping.
